# Colour Guessing Game

## Description

A simple guessing game where a random hexadecimal colour is generated and displayed on the screen.  The correct answer is assigned to a button along with two incorrect options which have been randomly generated.  The player has to try to descern which is the correct colour displayed and click the corresponding button.  If the incorrect colour is chosen by the player they will be asked to try again.  If the player answers correctly a new colour is generated along with three new buttons and the player is prompted to play again.  The game has been built using react 18.2.0.
